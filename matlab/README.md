# svGPFA

This repository contains code to run sparse variational Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (svGPFA). ~/demos contains scripts for example usage.

## supported likelihoods
* Gaussian
* Poisson (with exponential non-linearity)
* continuous-time point-process (with exponential non-linearity)

## supported kernel functions
* RBF
* Periodic

## Dependencies
* Matlab R2016b
* mtimesx package
